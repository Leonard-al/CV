  <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
  <p>Although I do enjoy <i><strong>Music production</strong></i> in my free time, I also like going on hikes and surfing. Staying active is important to me because when you have some time to just focus on nature, you can get sudden bursts of
    inspiration that come in handy during an app development process.</p>
